<h1>BIL TV+ Movie App</h1>
In this project we build a movie app like Netflix. We fetch the data from the movie database (TMDB) in our async functions.
We use swiper js to add a swiper slider. We created pagerouter function in Vanilla JS.

I followed this project from "Modern JS From The Beginning 2.0 (2024)" which a course owned by Brad Traversy and i get my own api key by creating an account on TMDB. (You should hide your api key in .env file)
